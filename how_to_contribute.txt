STEPS TO CONTRIBUTE TO A PUBLIC REPOSITORY:

Repository I am trying to contribute: bitgio/Seconda

Following the steps in the webpage: https://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/pages/fork.html

	IMPORTANT: to clone the Seconda's fork in my GitHub account I used
	the URL https://github.com/apascual303/Seconda, 
	not git@github.com:apascual303/Seconda. 
	In the latter case it somehow it doesn't clone it.
